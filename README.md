# 🧪 DemoBlaze QA Project  
### Comprehensive Testing Portfolio by Abdelrahman Ayman Abou Shmeila

This repository contains a **full end-to-end QA project** executed on the DemoBlaze e-commerce demo site.  
It demonstrates professional-level skills in:

- Requirement Analysis  
- Functional Testing  
- Regression Planning  
- Usability Testing (Nielsen's Heuristics)  
- Test Design & Test Execution  
- Defect Reporting  
- Release Management (Go/No-Go)  
- JIRA/Xray Traceability  
- QA Documentation & Reporting  

This project represents the **complete QA lifecycle** exactly as it would be performed in a real company.

## 📝 **Overview of the QA Work**

### 🔹 **1. Requirement Analysis**
- Identified gaps in user stories  
- Highlighted missing validation rules  
- Analyzed security, consistency, and functional completeness  
- Delivered a structured report of requirement issues

📄 *Files:*  
- `User stories.xlsx`  
- `User story issues.docx`

---

### 🔹 **2. Test Design**
Includes:
- Test scenarios  
- Detailed functional test cases (positive, negative, edge cases)  
- Traceability to user stories  

📄 *Files:*  
- `Functional test cases.xlsx`  
- `Functional test cases.csv`  
- `Test scenarios.xlsx`  

---

### 🔹 **3. Test Execution**
Performed manual execution across core flows:

- Login  
- Add to Cart  
- Checkout  
- Order Confirmation  

Results:
- **5 test cases executed**
- **3 Passed**
- **2 Failed**
- **2 Major defects logged**

📄 *Files:*  
- `Functional test report.docx`  
- `Defect logs.xlsx`

---

### 🔹 **4. Defect Management**
Logged high-severity defects linked to their related test cases and user stories:

- **D-001:** Login error exposes which field is incorrect (security risk)  
- **D-002:** Confirmation ticket date is wrong by one month (data integrity risk)

Includes impact, severity, priority, and traceability mapping.

📄 *Files:*  
- `Defect logs.xlsx`  
- `traceability.png`

---

### 🔹 **5. Usability Testing**
Conducted heuristic evaluation using **Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics**.

Findings included:
- Missing cart badge updates  
- Wrong date format  
- Poor modal keyboard handling (Esc/Enter)  
- Vague or inconsistent error messages  
- Login discoverability issues  

📄 *Files:*  
- `Usability report.docx`

---

### 🔹 **6. Regression Testing**
Created a regression strategy focused on high-risk flows:

- Filters  
- Sorting  
- Cart totals  
- Checkout  
- User flow transitions  

Includes:
- Impact analysis  
- Automation candidates  
- Entry/Exit criteria  
- Risk mitigation

📄 *Files:*  
- `Regression strategy.xlsx`  
- `Regression testing strategy.docx`

---

### 🔹 **7. Release Management**
Prepared:
- Release proposal  
- Risk assessment  
- Test summary  
- Go/No-Go decision (No-Go)  
- Recommendations for fixes  
- Next steps + regression plan

📄 *Files:*  
- `Release management proposal.pptx`  
- `Release report.docx`

---

## 🧩 **Tools Used**
- **JIRA + Xray** (test management, execution, traceability)  
- **Excel / CSV** (test design & defect tracking)  
- **Word / PPT** (reporting & release documentation)  
- **Nielsen’s Heuristics** (usability evaluation)  
- **Manual testing techniques**  
- *(Planned)* **Cypress automation with Page Object Model**

---
